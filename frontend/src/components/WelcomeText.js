        Thank you for visiting our Company. This is our automated signin system

        our facility. Click "Capture photo" once you are ready for your picture
        to be taken. Feel free to take as many as you want until you see one
        that you like. Review your visitor pass on the right and click "Print
        visitor Pass" when you are ready.
